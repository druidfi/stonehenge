# Symfony 6 example

## Requirements

- druidfi/stonehenge up & running

## Setup

Install Symfony 6 application with Composer:

```console
cd examples/symfony
make up
```

Wait. It takes some time to load all the files etc.

Access the site in https://symfony.docker.so/

## Teardown

You can tear down the whole example by:

```console
make down
```

This will put down the container and remove the Symfony app folder.
